These measured benefits of trastuzumab using expected life years and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Two studies were in the US, 2 in Europe and 1 in Australia. </p>\n    <p class=\"p\">One study considered both the 12-month and 9-week regimens. Most studies based their efficacy data on the NSABP-B31 and NCCTG N983 trials (and subsequent joint analysis) and the HERA trial. One study based its effectiveness on the BCIRG 006 trial. </p>\n    <p class=\"p\">Trastuzumab with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by paclitaxel (chemotherapy) was compared with chemotherapy alone. Two of the studies included the costs of HER2 testing in the model. The benefits of trastuzumab were accounted for in all models as the relative risk of recurrence. Most studies derived relative risks of recurrence from clinical trials. Three of the studies assumed that there was no added or diminished benefit from trastuzumab after the trial and benefits were assumed to be the same over the lifetime of the patient. The overall quality of these evaluations was judged to be good. </p>\n    <p class=\"p\">No study reported a base-case incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) above Â£30,000 per QALY despite variations in: </p>\n    <ul class=\"ul\">\n      <li class=\"li\">\n        <p class=\"p\">treatment regimens considered </p>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n    <ul class=\"ul\">\n      <li class=\"li\">\n        <p class=\"p\">modelling approaches </p>\n      </li>\n      <li class=\"li\">\n        <p class=\"p\">assumptions about the efficacy of trastuzumab beyond the trial period </p>\n      </li>\n      <li class=\"li\">\n        <p class=\"p\">including HER2 testing </p>\n      </li>\n      <li class=\"li\">\n        <p class=\"p\">considering using trastuzumab for metastatic breast cancer </p>\n      </li>\n      <li class=\"li\">\n        <p class=\"p\">including cardiac toxicity from trastuzumab. </p>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n  </div>\n</article></div></div>"},"metadata":{},"solr":{"custom":{},"doc":{"href_s":"SD00835149","url_s":"content/42af8b80-26ed-418b-b569-5947b243c365","title_s":"Cost utility studies","nextTopic_s":"04c5fc95-4e8f-4e59-8d52-e880a313d383","prevTopic_s":"14308ab3-647a-4007-815c-2b605e1b5a50"},"nice":{"nice_infotype_s":"evidence","nice_guideline-id_s":"","nice_content-id_s":"","nice_content-type_s":"","nice_condition-disease_s":"BreastCancer"}},"contentObject":{"publicationuuid":"75bfaa02-cc71-4a79-a7dd-dbc47541edea","contentuuid":"42af8b80-26ed-418b-b569-5947b243c365","contentjoinuuid":"aad780e8-1548-40dd-af6f-6121b6918db9","contentjoinuuids":["aad780e8-1548-40dd-af6f-6121b6918db9","b6411394-b182-48a0-932b-feab3de553ac"],"publicationjoinuuid":"356cbf6a-a380-418a-9856-781ae39f6dca"}}

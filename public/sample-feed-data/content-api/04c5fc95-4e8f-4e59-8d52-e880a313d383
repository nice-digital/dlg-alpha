These were developed using decision analytic models. Three studies were based on the 12-month trastuzumab regimen and 2 considered both the 12-month and 9-week regimens. These 2 based their efficacy data on the HERA and FinHer trials. One study based its efficacy data on the 2-year follow up of the HERA trial and the other studies based efficacy data on the NSABP-B31 and NCCTG N983 trials and the BCIRG 006 trial. </p>\n    <p class=\"p\">All the studies considered trastuzumab in people who had progressed to metastatic cancer. However, in some of the studies it was unclear whether the efficacy of trastuzumab in this setting was taken into account. The costs of HER2 testing were included in most studies. Some methodological issues meant these papers were not judged to be as good quality as the cost-utility studies. </p>\n    <p class=\"p\">In the study that examined the 2-year follow-up data from the HERA trial, the ICER did not exceed Â£30,000 per QALY gained. The cost-effectiveness studies generally found 1 year of trastuzumab treatment to be cost effective. </p>\n  </div>\n</article></div></div>"},"metadata":{},"solr":{"custom":{},"doc":{"href_s":"SD00835183","url_s":"content/04c5fc95-4e8f-4e59-8d52-e880a313d383","title_s":"Cost effectiveness analyses","nextTopic_s":"31d64fa2-8c2f-4aff-becd-a46f3dcb4b9f","prevTopic_s":"42af8b80-26ed-418b-b569-5947b243c365"},"nice":{"nice_infotype_s":"evidence","nice_guideline-id_s":"","nice_content-id_s":"","nice_content-type_s":"","nice_condition-disease_s":"BreastCancer"}},"contentObject":{"publicationuuid":"75bfaa02-cc71-4a79-a7dd-dbc47541edea","contentuuid":"04c5fc95-4e8f-4e59-8d52-e880a313d383","contentjoinuuid":"ac9b3bd7-c949-4f57-bea0-b485cce4017f","contentjoinuuids":["ac9b3bd7-c949-4f57-bea0-b485cce4017f","b6411394-b182-48a0-932b-feab3de553ac"],"publicationjoinuuid":"356cbf6a-a380-418a-9856-781ae39f6dca"}}

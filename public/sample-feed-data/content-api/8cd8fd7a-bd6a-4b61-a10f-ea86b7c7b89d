It also increases disease-free survival by about 40%. </p>\n      <p class=\"p\"> Although trastuzumab can cause heart problems, it should be offered to people with tumours that are T1c and above. This is because HER2-positivity increases the risk of recurrence, so a treatment that targets HER2 should be used (trastuzumab).Â  </p>\n    </section>\n    <section class=\"section impact\"><h2 class=\"title sectiontitle\">Quality of clinical evidence</h2>\n      \n      <p class=\"p\">When this recommendation was published in 2009, we judged the evidence to be good quality. </p>\n    </section>\n  </div>\n</article></div></div>"},"metadata":{},"solr":{"custom":{},"doc":{"href_s":"SD00835150","url_s":"content/8cd8fd7a-bd6a-4b61-a10f-ea86b7c7b89d","title_s":"Rationale","nextTopic_s":"b14ded4e-69fe-466d-b552-85189aa14568","prevTopic_s":"a2e5f692-4cb8-4d70-974e-672e8a22643c"},"nice":{"nice_infotype_s":"rationale-impact","nice_guideline-id_s":"","nice_content-id_s":"","nice_content-type_s":"","nice_condition-disease_s":"BreastCancer"}},"contentObject":{"publicationuuid":"75bfaa02-cc71-4a79-a7dd-dbc47541edea","contentuuid":"8cd8fd7a-bd6a-4b61-a10f-ea86b7c7b89d","contentjoinuuid":"e43484b9-c153-4378-b3a8-d2e230551432","contentjoinuuids":["e43484b9-c153-4378-b3a8-d2e230551432","b6411394-b182-48a0-932b-feab3de553ac"],"publicationjoinuuid":"356cbf6a-a380-418a-9856-781ae39f6dca"}}
